## 📌 Summary

This study investigates how novice users perform common computing tasks on MacOS and Windows. We looked at:
- Time taken to complete tasks ⏱️
- Number of clicks required 🖱️
- User satisfaction through SUS survey 📋

## 🔍 Key Findings

- **Windows** was found to be slightly more efficient and easier to use for novice users.
- **MacOS** had a steeper learning curve for users unfamiliar with it.
- Small sample size limits strong conclusions. Larger-scale studies are needed.

## 🧪 Experiment Details

- **Participants**: 9 graduate students with limited experience in the test OS
- **Tasks**: Basic day-to-day operations (e.g., taking photos, changing wallpaper, pinning apps)
- **Metrics**: Efficiency (time), Accuracy (clicks), Usability (SUS survey)

## 💡 Lessons Learned

- Participant bias and prior experience affected results
- Windows had a usability advantage, especially in efficiency
- Task design and OS familiarity are key to usability evaluation
